    <p>
        The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division,
        BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of the renumbering that splits the coup√© and convertible variants
        of the 3 Series into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3. Upgrades over the standard BMW
        4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including
        increased use of carbon fiber, such as on the roof of the car.
